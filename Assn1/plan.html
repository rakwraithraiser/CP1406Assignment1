<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Assuming that there is a player registration form, there should be a survey on where did the player gets information about Digger's. The website should be in the choices, and the success of the website could be measured from the number of players coming because of the website. Moreover, as an option, there should be a space where players can review the website, to know what it lacks.</p>
